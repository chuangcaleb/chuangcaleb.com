👋 **Welcome!** This 🪴 **garden** is like a blog, but more 🐬 _fluid_ – [read more here](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

I write notes in <Favicon img={ObsidianIcon} alt="obsidian logo" url="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</Favicon> for 📔 _daily journals_ and 🧠 _personal knowledge management_ (PKM) — but I also like to yap about 🎭 **narrative storytelling** and sometimes 💻 _tech stuff_, and perhaps you like to listen to yapping...

So I've exposed some of my notes on this site, especially **self-authored content**, so most of them are longform notes, for now. It's also a 🚧 **WIP**, while I refine the exporting script to grab more notes.
