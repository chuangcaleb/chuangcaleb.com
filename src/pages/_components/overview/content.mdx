# <Icon name="lucide:briefcase" /> Professionally
I am currently a **Software Engineer** at [Airasia MOVE](https://www.airasia.com/aa/appdownload/) @ [*LinkedIn*](https://www.linkedin.com/company/airasia-super-app/mycompany/). I work on **UI/UX & Network Logic** for our *flights booking web interfaces* at [airasia.com](https://airasia.com) — visual and technical design is fun!

# <Icon name="lucide:user-cog" /> Growing Up
I found aptitude in Redstone and [Game Dev/Design](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/calebchan/), where I first started coding. Through a [BSc Computer Science w AI](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/), I’ve found **Software Dev** (notably **Full-Stack Web**) as an accessible medium to create experiences.

# <Icon name="lucide:flame" />  My Passion
is in **Storytelling & Narratives**: *“finding universal truths of human experience, and translating them into cohesive drama”*[^](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/a-writer-or-a-storyteller). I express through **music, theatre, film, storyboarding** — even tech. I have a lot to say about story, if you’d like to [hear me](/garden)!

# <Icon name="lucide:trees" />  Digital Garden
I also upkeep a Digital Garden with *[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)* — I journal daily & write down everything I learn. I publicly expose a subset of my notes at [/garden](/garden)!
