**Welcome!** This is like a blog, except more *fluid* – [read more here](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

I write notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for *daily journals* and *personal knowledge management* (PKM) — but I also like to yap about **narrative storytelling** and sometimes *tech stuff*, and perhaps you like to listen to yapping...

So I've exposed some of my notes on this site, especially **self-authored content**, so most of them are longform notes for now. It's also a **WIP**, while I refine the exporting script to grab more notes.
