👋 **Welcome!** This 🪴 **garden** is like a blog, but more 🐬 *fluid* – [read more here](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

I write notes in <Favicon src="https://obsidian.md/images/obsidian-logo-gradient.svg" alt="obsidian logo" url="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</Favicon> for 📔 *daily journals* and 🧠 *personal knowledge management* (PKM) — but I also like to yap about **🎭 narrative storytelling** and sometimes 💻 *tech stuff*, and perhaps you like to listen to yapping...

So I've exposed some of my notes on this site, especially **self-authored content**, so most of them are longform notes, for now. It's also a 🚧 **WIP**, while I refine the exporting script to grab more notes.
