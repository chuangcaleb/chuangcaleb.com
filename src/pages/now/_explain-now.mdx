## "/now" shows latest life updates

I'll regularly post what I'm currently **focused on** & how I'm doing, over the past month-ish. It's my own up-to-date public activity feed.

You can bookmark this permalink: <AccentA href='https://chuangcaleb.com/now' >{"https://chuangcaleb.com/now"}</AccentA>. You can check back every 1st day of the month!

This page will always show the **latest entry** — previous logs are archived and can be found at the ["now" collection page](/note/now).
