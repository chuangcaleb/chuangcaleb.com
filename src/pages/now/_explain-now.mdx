## "/now" shows latest life updates

I'll regularly post what I'm currently **focused on** & how I'm doing, over
the past month-ish. I already do journaling daily anyways.

People ask, "what are you up to lately?" — I can collect everything in a
centralized location and show/share people the link to this page. It's my
own up-to-date public activity feed. You can bookmark this permalink: <AccentA href='https://chuangcaleb.com/now' >{"https://chuangcaleb.com/now"}</AccentA>

This page will always show the **latest entry** — previous logs are archived
and can be found at the ["now" collection page](/note/now).

"Now" pages were started by [nownownow.com/about](https://nownownow.com/about) — read more there!
