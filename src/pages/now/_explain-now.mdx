## "/now" shows latest life updates

I'll regularly post what I'm currently **focused on** & how I'm doing, over the past month-ish. It's my own up-to-date public activity feed.

You can bookmark this permalink: <a href='https://chuangcaleb.com/now' >{"https://chuangcaleb.com/now"}</a>. You can check back every 1st day of the month!

This page will always show the **latest entry** — previous logs are archived and can be found at the ["now" collection page](/notes/now).

"Now" pages were started by [nownownow.com/about](https://nownownow.com/about) — read more there!
